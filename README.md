# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: improper exception handling within asynchronous functions using `async` and `await`. The example showcases how to correctly handle exceptions and re-throw them for higher-level handling.

## The Problem

The initial code lacks proper error handling, potentially leading to silent failures.  Exceptions thrown within the `try` block aren't properly propagated, making debugging difficult.

## The Solution

The solution includes a `rethrow` statement. This ensures that exceptions are not swallowed but instead bubble up to be handled by a higher-level `catch` block or cause program termination if unhandled, leading to more robust and predictable code.
